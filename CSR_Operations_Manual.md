## Quick Rules (Read First!)

### ⏰ When You Can Call

```
✅ YES: Between 8:00 AM and 9:00 PM (customer's local time)
❌ NO: Before 8:00 AM or after 9:00 PM
❌ NO: Sundays (unless business is open Sundays)

Best times to call:
• Tuesday-Thursday
• Between 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM
• Avoid Monday mornings and Friday afternoons
```

### 📞 Who You Can Call

```
✅ YES - You can call these WITHOUT special permission:
   • Business office phone numbers (landlines)
   • Business listed on Google Maps
   • Companies you find online

⚠️ MAYBE - Need to check first:
   • Mobile/cell phone numbers (even if it's a business)
   • You must check the "Do Not Call List" first

❌ NO - NEVER call these:
   • Anyone on the "Do Not Call List"
   • Anyone who said "don't call me again"
   • Phone numbers marked as "OPT-OUT" in your system
```

### 💬 Text Messages (SMS)

```
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Texting has STRICTER rules than calling!

You can ONLY send text messages to people who:
   1. Gave you written permission, AND
   2. Are NOT on the Do Not Call List

If you're not 100% sure = DON'T TEXT THEM
```

---

## Your Daily Morning Checklist

**Do these steps EVERY morning before making ANY calls:**

### ☐ Step 1: Log Into All Systems

```
☐ Open your calling system (Twilio/dialer)
☐ Open your customer database (CRM)
☐ Open the Do Not Call checking tool
☐ Make sure your headset/phone is working
☐ Check your internet connection
```

### ☐ Step 2: Get Today's Calling List

```
☐ Download or open today's list of numbers to call
☐ Make sure you can see these columns:
   • Name
   • Company
   • Phone Number
   • Type (Landline or Mobile)
   • Last Call Date
```

### ☐ Step 3: Check the Do Not Call List

```
⚠️ CRITICAL: This must be done EVERY day!

☐ Run your calling list through the DNC checker
☐ Remove any numbers that show up as "Do Not Call"
☐ Remove any numbers marked as "Opt-Out" in your system
☐ Save the cleaned list

Ask your manager if you don't know how to do this!
```

### ☐ Step 4: Review Your Scripts

```
☐ Read your call script out loud once
☐ Practice saying the company name correctly
☐ Have a pen and paper ready for notes
```

### ☐ Step 5: Check Your Phone Number

```
☐ Make sure you're calling from the right number
☐ Verify your Caller ID shows correctly
☐ It should show: [Your company name] + local area code

Never show:
   ❌ "Unknown"
   ❌ "Private"
   ❌ "Blocked"
```

**✅ Once all 5 steps are done, you can start calling!**

---

## Before You Call ANYONE

### Check Each Number Before Dialing

**For EVERY single call, do this quick check:**

```
1. Look at the phone number

2. Ask yourself:
   ☐ Is this a landline or mobile number?
   ☐ Is this number on the Do Not Call list? (Should already be removed)
   ☐ Did this person ask not to be called before?
   ☐ Have I already called them today?

3. Check the time:
   ☐ Is it between 8 AM - 9 PM in THEIR time zone?
   
4. Check if they're in your system:
   ☐ Look for notes like "DO NOT CALL" or "OPT-OUT"
   
5. If everything looks good → Make the call
   If anything looks wrong → SKIP this number
```

### Is It a Landline or Mobile?

**Why this matters:** Mobile phones have stricter rules!

**How to tell:**

```
Landline numbers usually:
• Listed as "business" in your database
• Show office hours
• Answer with company name

Mobile numbers usually:
• Start with mobile area codes
• Marked as "cell" in your database  
• Personal voicemail greeting

⚠️ When in doubt:
   → If your system says "Mobile" = Treat it as mobile
   → If unsure = Ask your supervisor
```

**Rules for Mobile Numbers:**

```
If it's a MOBILE number, you can only call if:
   ✅ Your manager marked it as "Approved for calling"
   ✅ The system shows you have "consent" to call them
   
If you don't see "Approved" or "Consent" = SKIP IT
```

---

## How to Make a Call

### Step-by-Step Calling Process

#### Step 1: Prepare

```
☐ Have the customer's information on your screen:
   • Name
   • Company name
   • Phone number
   • Reason for calling
   
☐ Have your script ready

☐ Have a pen ready to take notes

☐ Take a deep breath and smile (they can hear it!)
```

#### Step 2: Dial the Number

```
☐ Click "Call" in your system OR dial manually

☐ Wait for it to ring (don't hang up too quickly)

☐ Let it ring 4-5 times before hanging up

☐ If voicemail picks up → Follow voicemail script (see below)
```

#### Step 3: When Someone Answers

**First 10 seconds are CRITICAL! Say this:**

```
"Hello, this is [YOUR NAME] calling from [COMPANY NAME].
May I speak with [CONTACT NAME] please?"

Example:
"Hello, this is Sarah calling from ABC Marketing.
May I speak with John Smith please?"

Stay professional and friendly!
```

#### Step 4: If You Get the Right Person

**Follow your call script, but remember to:**

```
✅ Use their name

✅ Be polite and respectful
✅ Listen carefully to their responses
✅ Take notes in your system
```

#### Step 5: Ending the Call

## How to Send Text Messages

> ⚠️ **WARNING: Text messages have VERY STRICT RULES!**  
> Breaking these rules = Big fines for the company!

### Before Sending ANY Text Message

**Check ALL of these:**

```
☐ Is this person marked as "SMS APPROVED" in your system?
☐ Did they give written permission to text them?
☐ Are they NOT on the Do Not Call list?
☐ Have they texted us before (showing they want texts)?
☐ Is it between 8 AM - 9 PM their local time?

If ANY answer is NO = DO NOT SEND THE TEXT!

When in doubt, ask your supervisor!
```

### Text Message Rules

#### ✅ What You MUST Include in Every Text

```
Every business text message MUST have:

1. Your company name
2. Why you're texting
3. How to opt-out

Example:
"Hi John! This is Sarah from ABC Marketing. We have 
a special offer for your business. Reply STOP to 
unsubscribe."

All three parts are REQUIRED!
```

#### 📱 Text Message Format

**Good example:**

```
"Hi [Name]! This is [Your Name] from [Company]. 
[Brief message - 1-2 sentences]. 
Reply STOP to opt out."
```

**Real example:**

```
"Hi Lisa! This is Mike from Studio Solutions. 
We're offering 50% off AI assistants this month 
for new customers. Reply STOP to opt out."
```

### If Someone Replies "STOP"

**This is CRITICAL - Follow these steps IMMEDIATELY:**

```
1. DO NOT send them any more messages

2. Reply once (you're allowed one reply):
   "You've been unsubscribed from ABC Marketing. 
   You won't receive more messages."

3. Mark their record as "SMS OPT-OUT"

4. Report to your manager the same day

5. Never text them again (even if they call you later)
```

**Other opt-out words to watch for:**

```
If they reply with ANY of these, treat it as STOP:
• STOP
• QUIT  
• END
• CANCEL
• UNSUBSCRIBE
• NO
• REMOVE

→ Stop texting them immediately!
```

### Text Message Timing

```
Best times to send texts:
✅ Tuesday - Thursday
✅ 10 AM - 5 PM (their local time)

Avoid:
❌ Before 8 AM or after 9 PM
❌ Weekends (unless you have special permission)
❌ Holidays
```

### How Many Texts Can You Send?

```
Maximum per person:
• 1 text per day
• 3 texts per week  
• If no response after 3 texts = STOP trying

Never bombard someone with messages!

**A:** Don't panic! Immediately:
1. Mark them as "DO NOT CALL"
2. Tell your manager right away
3. Write detailed notes about what happened
4. Learn from it - be more careful with your DNC checks

One accident won't get you fired, but repeated mistakes will.

---

### Q: Can I call businesses on weekends?

**A:** Maybe - ask your manager first! 

Generally:
- **Saturday**: Sometimes OK for businesses that work Saturdays
- **Sunday**: Usually NO (most businesses closed)

Default rule: Stick to Monday-Friday unless told otherwise.

---

### Q: What if someone asks "How did you get my number?"

**A:** Be honest!

Say: "We found your business listed on Google Maps / online directory / [wherever you actually found it]. Would you like me to remove you from our list?"

Never lie!

---

### Q: Can I text someone if they didn't answer my call?

**A:** ONLY if they're marked "SMS APPROVED" in your system!

Just because you can call them doesn't mean you can text them.

Texting has stricter rules!

---

### Q: What if I'm not sure if a number is landline or mobile?

**A:** Check your system first - it should show line type.

If still not sure:
1. Ask your supervisor
2. When in doubt, treat it as MOBILE (safer)
3. Only call if you have permission for mobile numbers

---

### Q: How many times can I call the same person?

**A:** General rule:

- Same day: Once only
- Same week: Maximum 2-3 times

Quality over quantity!

---

### Q: Can I call from my personal cell phone?

**A:** Ask:

"When would be a good time to call back for [NAME]?"

Then:
- Make a note in your system

OR offer:
"Can I leave a voicemail?" or "Can I send them an email?"

---

### Q: What if someone asks for my personal phone number?

**A:** Give the company number instead!
